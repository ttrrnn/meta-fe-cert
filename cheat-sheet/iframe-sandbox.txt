Cheat Sheet: iFrame Sandbox

<iframe> is the inline frame element that embeds an HTML page into another page

Element-specific Attributes

allow
Specifies what features or permissions are available to the frame e.g. mic access, camera, APIs, etc
* allow=“fullscreen” — the fullscreen mode can be activated
* allow=“geolocation” — lets you access user’s location

To specific more than one feature, use semi-colon

<iframe src="https://example.com" allow="camera; microphone"> </iframe>

name
Name for iframe

<iframe name = "My Frame" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

height / width
Specifics height / width of the iframe. 
Height defaults to 150px
Width defaults to 300px

referrerpolicy
Referrer is the HTTP header that lets the page know who is loading it. This attribute indicates which referrer information to send when loading the frame resource. Common values are:
* no-referrer — referrer header will not be sent
* origin — referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page
* strict-origin — origin of the document is sent as the referrer only when using the same protocol security level (HTTPS to HTTPS) 

sandbox
To enforce greater security, a sandbox applies extra restrictions to the content in the <iframe>.
To life particular restrictions, an attribute value (permission token) is used.
Common permission tokens:
* allow-downloads — allows user to download an item
* allow-forms — allow users to submit forms
* allow-modals — resource can open modal windows
* allow-orientation-lock — lets the resource lock the screen orientation
* allow-popups — allows popups to open
* allow-presentation — allows a presentation session to start
* allow-scripts — lets the resource run scripts without creating popup windows

Value of attribute is empty, all restrictions applied.
To apply 1+ permission, use space-separated list

<iframe src="my_iframe_sandbox.html" sandbox="allow forms allow-scripts"> </iframe>

src
URL of the page to embed in the <iframe>.Use about:blank would embed an empty page

srcdoc
Lets you specify the inline HTML to embed in the <iframe>. 
When defined, attribute would override src

The following would display “My inline html” in the frame instead of loading my_iframe_src.html

<iframe src="my_iframe_src.html" srcdoc="<p>My inline html</p>"></iframe>

loading
Lets your specify if the iframe should be loaded immediately when the web page loads (eager) or loaded when iframe is displayed in the browser (lazy).
Allows you to defer loading iframe content if it is further down your page and outside of the display area when page is initially loaded.

<iframe src="my_iframe_src.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>

title
Lets you add a description to the iframe for accessibility purposes.
Value should accurately describe the iframe’s content

<iframe src="history.html" title="An embedded document about the history of my family"></iframe>
